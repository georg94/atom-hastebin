# atom-hastebin package

Quickly upload your code to a hastebin server.

Out of the box the plugin uploads your document to [hastebin.com](http://hastebin.com/). If you have your own hastebin server you will have to edit the settings.

If the upload was successfull the hastebin is opened in you browser by default. You can also let the link be copied to you clipboard.
